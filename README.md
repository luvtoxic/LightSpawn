# LightSpawn

**A lightweight, async Minecraft spawn plugin for fast and flexible player teleportation.**

LightSpawn is built for **speed** and **flexibility**, with fully asynchronous operations that keep the **main thread completely lag-free**. 

Using `CompletableFuture` and minimal executors, it handles **spawns**, **teleports**, and **join events** in just milliseconds. A thread-safe `ConcurrentHashMap` cache ensures **instant access** to player data, while **lightweight JSON storage** keeps everything fast and efficient.

From **first-join behavior** to **bed spawn support**, LightSpawn is **optimized**, **thread-safe**, and designed to be **endlessly customizable** for any server setup.
